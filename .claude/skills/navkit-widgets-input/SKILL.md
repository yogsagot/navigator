description: navkit's widget tree and input routing (navkit/widget.py, application.py, events.py, commands.py, screen.py) -- the event loop and frame order, Widget geometry and render_tree, focus and dispatch_key, emitting events, async `on_*` handlers, mounted()/unmounting(), modal and overlay, the cursor, mouse routing and capture, raise_child, shadows, double-click, call_every timers, hover, commands, key tables, enables()/checks(), and the key bar. Use when handling keys, mouse or events, adding a command or key binding, or debugging focus.

# Widgets, events, focus and commands

## The loop and the tree

- `Application` owns the only asyncio loop. Input arrives through `loop.add_reader` into `InputParser`. **One turn:
  dispatch the whole batch, flush the reactive effects it queued, then paint one frame** -- a paste or drag costs one
  repaint. `SIGWINCH` becomes a `ResizeEvent`; events reach `Application.on_*` hooks first and the tree second.
- `Surface` is what widgets paint into; `ScreenBuffer` owns cells; `surface.view(x, y, w, h)` is a clipped window.
  `render_tree` hands each widget a view of its own area, so **widgets paint from `0, 0` in their own size and cannot
  draw outside themselves**. Wide characters occupy a cell plus a continuation; at a right edge one degrades to a blank.
  `render_diff()` emits only changed escapes. `Widget.render_after` paints over children.
- `Widget` geometry, `visible`, `style` and `parent` are reactive. **All coordinates are relative to the parent**
  (`x`/`y`, `contains()`, a `MouseClickEvent`'s position, shifted by `dispatch_mouse`); the root sits at the origin.
  `render(surface)` paints; `layout(width, height)` is called on the root at every resize and steps around any size
  that carries a binding (no `self.x +` arithmetic anywhere).

## Failures: never silent

- **Every exception escaping application code goes through `Application.fail(error, fatal=False)`**: handlers
  (`_handle`), ticks, effects (`_flush_effects`), a widget's `render`/`render_after` (`Widget._guarded`), spawned tasks
  (`_finished`), loop callbacks (`loop.set_exception_handler`, installed by `run_async`) and raw threads
  (`threading.excepthook`). Before this, a spawned task's failure was re-raised inside a done-callback: asyncio printed
  it into the alternate screen, which was then wiped, and `run()` returned 0.
- `fail` calls `log_error(error)` (does nothing in navkit) every time, then offers `report_error(error)`. If that
  returns True, the application carries on. Otherwise the error is kept, `exit()` is called, and **`run_async` raises it
  after `terminal.stop()`**, so the traceback reaches a normal screen. The default `report_error` returns False, which
  keeps tests strict.
- It always stops when `fatal` is true (`on_start`, `on_stop`, the frame machinery in `_paint`), when the loop is not
  running, when a failure occurs inside `report_error`, or after more than `ERROR_STORM_LIMIT` (5) failures in
  `ERROR_STORM_WINDOW` (10 s).
- **A widget whose paint fails does not take the frame down.** It is retried every frame and reported only when its
  `(type, message)` changes, so one broken window is one box, not one per frame.
- An effect that fails puts the rest of its batch back on the queue (`Scheduler.flush`), and `_flush_effects` runs
  them in the same turn.
- **A stall is logged too, though nothing failed.** `_main_loop` sets `handling_since`/`handling` from taking a batch
  until it is painted, and `_handle` keeps the last 64 input events in `recent_events` (`describe_event`: key names,
  never paste text; no ticks or bare motion). Navigator's `errorlog.Watchdog`, a daemon thread, reads only those
  plain fields. When a batch is older than `[system] stall_report` seconds (default 2, 0 off) it writes one `STALL`
  entry to `errors.log`: the recent input, every thread's stack (faulthandler), and every task's stack, asked of the
  loop with `call_soon_threadsafe`. When the loop does not answer within 1 s, the entry says the loop thread is
  blocked (a syscall on the loop: look at the threads); when it answers, a handler is awaiting something (look at the
  tasks). `STALL ENDED after N s` follows. `kill -USR1 <pid>` dumps every thread's stack there at any moment.

## Focus and keys

- `Application.focused` holds the widget keys go to; `Widget.can_focus` (False by default) says who may; `focus()` takes
  it, `Application.focus_next()` moves it. `Widget.focused` is a computed (so `:focused` is a sheet state).
  `dispatch_key` walks the focus path, nearest first -- **with nothing focused a key reaches no widget at all**.
  Eligibility is decided when the key arrives.

## Events and handlers

- `Widget.emit(event)` walks from the widget up through ancestors to the application, stopping at the first handler
  returning True. An event class names its handler (`ClickEvent` -> `on_click`, `Event.handler`). A widget declares
  what it raises with `emits = (ClickEvent,)`, read through `navkit.events.emitted(cls)`, which unions down the MRO.
- **Every `on_*` handler is `async def`**; navkit refuses a synchronous one (at class creation, or at the call for one
  assigned onto an instance). **A hook that cannot be awaited where it is called gets no `on_*` name**: `mounted()` and
  `unmounting()` are plain sync callbacks. `Application.on_start`/`on_stop` are awaited by `run_async`. An awaiting
  handler lets the loop run mid-batch but **cannot cause a repaint**.
- `navkit/events.py` carries only events navkit itself raises (terminal input, the loop's wake); everything a widget
  means belongs to the library.
- `dispatch_mouse` offers to the topmost child first under `event.handler` (so a refinement reaches its own handler).
  `Application.capture_mouse` gives a dragging widget the mouse.

## Lifecycle, modal, cursor

- `Widget.is_mounted` says whether a widget is in an application's tree; `mounted()`/`unmounting()` are called by the
  walks `Application.root`, `add()` and `remove()` drive. **`remove()` disposes the subtree's effects** -> effects go in
  `mounted()`.
- `Widget.modal` makes a widget take all input while mounted (the mount walks maintain `Application.modal`);
  `Application.overlay(widget)` puts one on top, closed with `app.root.remove(widget)`. Focus is confined and handed
  back. `Widget.dims_behind = False` keeps a modal layer from dimming (`--no-dim-modal` turns dimming off globally).
  **The dimmed twin of a style is kept across frames** (`Application._dimmed`): `render_diff` rules out an unchanged
  row with one list comparison only while its cells hold the *same* style objects as last frame, and a fresh twin
  per frame made it compare every cell's style field by field -- tripling a frame's cost under a progress box.
- **A frame reuses what lies beneath the top modal** (`Application._underlay`, taken in `_painting_modal` after the dim
  while `_render` paints the whole tree) and paints only the modal and what stands above it (`_render_above`: the
  modal's subtree, then each ancestor's later children and `render_after`). Only when nothing beneath can have
  changed: `Widget.invalidate` passes itself to `Application.invalidate(widget)`, and anything outside the top modal,
  an `invalidate()` naming no widget, a modal pushed or popped, a resize, or **any event but a timer's `_Tick`** sets
  `_below_dirty`. Input is excluded because per-widget damage misses derived values (a key bar's enabled command
  reading a field); a tick says through `invalidate` what it changed. What it buys: a progress box over the desktop
  costs its own subtree per tick, not the whole tree. A widget beneath a modal that changes **plain** state on a tick
  must call `invalidate()` itself -- nothing else repaints it now.
- **Raising is a reorder**: `raise_child`/`lower_child`, never re-`add()` (that unmounts). `Widget.shadow` is painted by
  `render_tree` into the parent's surface.
- `Widget.cursor_position()` says where the terminal cursor belongs; the application asks **the whole focus path,
  nearest first**, at the end of each frame, so a caret only shows where keys go. The `caret` property sets DECSCUSR
  from a sheet.

## Double-click and timers

- `ClickTracker` synthesises `DoubleClickEvent` from two presses and a clock. **The press is still delivered** (the
  double-click is additional); dispatched inline after that press, re-entering `_handle` so `on_event` sees it; navkit's rather than the library's
  because `Application._loop.time()` is the only clock event handling can reach; keyed on exact cell and button; counts upward
  (a triple click raises one); forgotten on wheel, resize or modal push/pop. `DOUBLE_CLICK_TIMEOUT` 0.4, overridable via
  `Application(double_click=...)`. Clockless by construction (told `now`).
- **A right press is offered twice**: as itself, then inline as a `ContextMenuEvent` (`on_context_menu`) along the
  same route. It is not raised when a widget held the capture before the press, when the press took it, or for a
  press outside the modal. navkit says where a menu was asked for; navml's `ContextMenuHost` decides what it is
  (`navml-windows-menus`). `run_command(binding, start=)` runs a command from a widget other than the focus.
- **`bindings(app, start)` / `key_for`** add the application's table only when there is no modal or *start* lies
  outside it (asking about the focus behind it); a *start* inside the modal gets the modal's keys, as a key would.
- **The one clock is `Application.call_every(seconds, async_callback)`**, returning a cancellable `Repeat`; callable
  before the loop runs; every tick is posted and awaited inside a dispatch.
- Hover: a position the application keeps (`hovered` state). `Application.pointer` is the last reported `(x, y)` of
  any mouse report, plain motion included -- a plain attribute, not reactive (the screen savers' corners read it).
- **Tooltips**: `Widget.tooltip` (a string, `""` for none; translated in markup) shows beside the pointer after it
  rests `Application.tooltip_delay` milliseconds (1000, `TOOLTIP_DELAY`; 0 off). Asked through `Widget.tooltip_at(x, y)`,
  own coordinates, from `hovered` up -- the nearest non-empty wins; a widget painting several things (navml's
  `OptionStrip`, and `Window`'s chrome icons through `chrome_hit`) overrides it. A widget with `tooltip_passes = False` stops the
  climb: navml's `ScrollBar`, which its list would otherwise answer for with the row at that height. **Only a plain motion arms it** (`Application.call_later`, a one-shot `Repeat`);
  **any other input but a tick drops it**, shown or pending. Shown as navkit's `Tooltip` overlaid as the root's last
  child (so over a modal too), geometry bound, flipping left/up at the edges. No mode 1003, no tooltips from the
  pointer -- Shift+F11 instead (below).
  Navigator follows Interface Setup's *Tooltip delay* (`[interface] tooltip_delay`) by an effect in `on_start`.
- **A tooltip follows on**: one taken down by the pointer moving on leaves the next quick for `TOOLTIP_FOLLOW_ON`
  (2 s): armed with `TOOLTIP_FOLLOW_ON_DELAY` (0.08 s), not the whole delay. A key or a press ends that.
- **A key is set apart only in `navkit.tooltip.Markup`**, a `str` whose `~` runs paint in `Tooltip::key`
  (`caption_runs`, now `navkit/text.py`, navml re-exporting it). Build one with `with_keys(text, keys)` --
  never `f"{text} ({key})"` -- and join lines with `navkit.tooltip.lines()`, which keeps it Markup and escapes the
  plain parts; concatenating a Markup gives a plain `str`. A plain `str` is painted as it is, so a file name or a path
  is never escaped. Tests compare `plain(text)`.
- **Shift+F11 shows the tooltip of where the keyboard is** (`navkit.tooltip.ShowTooltip`, bound in `Navigator.keys`
  and so in `keybindings.ini`'s `[global]`), until the next key. The application looks it up in its own table
  itself, so it works past a modal, where that table otherwise stands aside. Where is
  `Widget.tooltip_anchor()` of the focused widget -- the caret, else the corner; a list's cursor row, a cluster's
  `sel`, a tab, a panel's cursor name, a calendar's day, an open menu's row override it -- asked as the pointer
  would be there (`Application.tooltip_from`). A focusable widget that paints several things needs an anchor.
- **A greyed command says why**: `Widget.refusal(command) -> str`, `""` when it will run; `enables` is
  `not refusal(...)` by default, so override `refusal`, not `enables`, and the reason cannot drift from the veto.
  `commands.disabled_reason` / `Application.command_disabled_reason` ask the widget `target()` would. A greyed menu
  row (`MenuBox.hint`), key bar item and option strip item add it to their tooltip; a button has none (buttons do
  not go through commands). A widget overriding only `enables` greys with no reason.
- **While a menu is open the key bar is its hint line**, TV's `THintStatusLine`: `MenuBar.hint()` (the top box's
  row, its reason, else the bar caption's tooltip) painted across `KeyBar` (`menu_hint()`), the items and their
  tooltips standing aside. The menu session answers for the bar beneath it (`MenuSession.tooltip_at`).

## Commands and key tables

- A command is an `Event` subclass (`class MakeDirectory(Command)` -> `on_make_directory`), emitted from the focused
  widget up. A key table is a class attribute `keys = {"f7": MakeDirectory}` or a markup `keys:` block, consulted at
  each step of the focus path before that widget's `on_key`; the application's table before the tree, **never under a
  modal**.
- **The nearest widget with the handler decides whether the command is enabled** (`enables(command)`); a command nobody
  handles is disabled, and a disabled command's key falls through as if unbound. `checks(command)` gives menu ticks.
- **Run-time overrides**: `override_keys(cls, table, base)` makes `cls`'s keys `key_table(base) | table` in place of
  what the classes between bind (so a key can be removed); `restore_keys()`, `default_keys()`, `own_keys()`,
  `check_table()`. `key_table` honours them at every lookup, so they are live at once. Navigator's `keybindings.ini`
  is the user of it (`navigator-keybindings`).
- Where bindings sit: `Navigator.keys` holds Ctrl+O, F1, F10 (the menu), Alt+X, and Enter/Home/End for the command
  line (Alt+X is on the application because a way out cannot live on a window the user can close); `manager.nml`
  holds Tab, Alt+R/Ctrl+R and F2-F8; `Desktop.keys` the window keys; `dialog.nml` Esc, Enter and Tab.
- **Chords**: a spec may be keys separated by a blank, `"ctrl+k b"` (`parse_key`, `key_label` -> `Ctrl-K B`). A table
  may not bind a key both alone and as a chord's start. `Application._chord_key` runs before the key tables: a key
  that begins a chord bound by a table *on the current path* (the application's unless a modal is up, then the focus
  path's) is held in the reactive `Application.chord`; the next key completes it -- looked up in the same tables,
  same order -- or is swallowed with it, never typed. Off the path a prefix key is an ordinary key, so Ctrl+K still
  reaches a program in the console.
- An instance in a table (`GoParent(by_key=True)`) lets `enables` treat the key and the menu differently.
- Key names: a bare `+` is `plus`, a bare Space is named `space` (its `key` is `" "`), keypad operators
  `kp_plus`/`kp_minus`/`kp_multiply`/`kp_divide`.
- **Where commands live**: with the group that handles them, one `commands.py` per group (`navigator/widgets/shell/`,
  `manager/`, `viewer/`, `editor/`, `file_ops/`); `navigator/commands.py` keeps Help, Quit, ToggleConsole.
  `navml/commands.py` holds the window set, `navml/widgets/dialog/commands.py` and `navml/widgets/menu/commands.py`
  theirs. Per group because a component's `__init__.py` imports its widget.
- **The key bar reads captions off the bindings** (`app.bindings()`), greys disabled commands in `$bar-disabled`, and a
  click runs the command. While Alt/Ctrl/Shift is held it shows that modifier's row (`StatusDef hcFilePanel`'s `-`/`+`/`:` items, bound in
  `manager.nml`) (`Application.modifiers`, needs the
  kitty protocol -- see `navkit-terminal`).
- **Every key hint goes on the key bar, never in a frame** (the user's rule). Keys a widget takes that no key table
  names -- a list's Space, a mode's arrows, a popup's `keys=` -- are `Widget.key_hints()`: `(label, caption)` pairs,
  translated, read from state. The bar (`navigator/widgets/shell/keybar/keybar.py`) asks every widget from the focus
  out, the nearest winning a label; a hint labelled `F2` takes F2's slot, the rest lead before the function keys
  (they say what the keyboard does now; a panel's ten F-keys fill 80 columns, so the last give way). Hints are
  `Hint` items: never greyed, a click does nothing. Tests read them with conftest's `key_bar_hints(app)`.
- **A key bar item's tooltip is its command's menu path** (`File > Make directory`, `...` dropped) through
  `KeyBar.menu.path_to()`; a command in no menu shows its caption, a hint nothing.
