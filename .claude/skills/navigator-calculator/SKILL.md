# The calculator (Ctrl+F6)

- **One window, four faces** (`CalculatorWindow.mode`, `[calculator] mode`, default `simple`): *Classic* is DN's
  `dlgCalculator` (the line in five forms, *Copy As*, Evaluate/Copy/Close); *Simple*, *Scientific* and *Programming*
  put a pad of keys under the same line. Not DN's: a departure, asked for. Ctrl+F6 still finds the one window;
  with it already in front it goes to the next face (the window's own table binds `ctrl+f6: Calculator`, which the
  shell handles -- the manager's table alone did before, so Ctrl+F6 did nothing inside the calculator).
- **Choosing a face**: the strip of four radio buttons along the top (`mode_strip`, two by two in the narrow faces),
  the window's *Calculator* menu after *File* (ticked through `checks()`; also its right-click menu), and Ctrl+1..4
  (which legacy terminals do not send -- hence Ctrl+F6). `set_mode()` shows the face, rebuilds the pad, takes the
  face's size (`SIZES`, each fitting an 80x24 desktop of 21 rows; `place()` keeps it on the desktop), puts the
  keyboard in the line unless `focus=False` (the strip's effect keeps it on the strip) and saves the mode.
- **The pads are an expression tape**: a key types into the line at its cursor, as the keyboard does, and the value
  is worked out under it; Enter or `=` evaluates (`closed()` shuts brackets left open), keeps the line in the `calc`
  history and leaves the value selected (`CalcLine.result_selected`: a digit starts afresh, anything else goes on).
  A function key wraps the operand before the cursor (`wrap_last`: `9` √ is `SQRT(9)`) or, with none, starts its
  bracket. `PadButton`s never take focus; a press is `PadPressed(key)`, handled by `press_key()`.
- **`calculator.evaluate(text, context)`**: `CLASSIC` (the default) is DN's exactly, tested as such. A `Context`
  adds `angle` (deg/rad/grad, for SIN..TAN and the inverses, DN's ARCTAN too; whole quarter turns exact), `ans`
  (`ANS`), and the programmer's `radix`/`bits`/`signed`: whole numbers only, `/` truncating, every result wrapped
  (`wrap`), a bare digit run read in the radix (in 16 a run of `0-9A-F`, so `E` is fourteen and `101b` is hex;
  `$FF`/`0x` still work). The word operators `AND OR XOR NAND NOR MOD SHL SHR SAR ROL ROR NOT` are names the
  tokenizer turns into operators; none is all hex digits.
- **Programming**: the base chosen beside the four forms (`base`), the word (`word`) and *Signed*; changing any of
  them writes the line's value in the new (`_follow_switches`). Digits past the base are greyed on the pad and
  refused from the keyboard. Into and out of Programming the line's value is carried
  (`_carry`); between the others the text stays. *Bit toggling keypad* (`bit_keypad`) puts `BitGrid` in the pad's
  place: 64 bits in four rows, a click or Space flips one (`BitFlipped`).
- **What the line takes** is the face's (`calculator_window.accepts(mode, radix)`, set on `CalcLine.accepts` by
  `_follow_radix`): Simple digits and `.+-*/%^()`; Scientific those plus letters (function names), `!` and `,`;
  Programming the base's digits (either case) and `+-*/%^()&|\~<>`, its named operators coming from the pad with
  their spaces. No space in any of them. A paste loses its spaces and is refused whole for any other stray
  character. Classic's `accepts` is empty: anything, as DN's line. Only typing and pasting are filtered; the pad
  writes the line directly.
- **Memory and `Ans`** are the window's, shared by the faces, not saved.
- **Settings are written untracked** (`_keep`): the effects that save them follow the window's controls; reading
  `SETTINGS` inside them subscribed them to it, and a second window's (or an old test's) effect wrote its switches
  back over a change.
- **The pad captions are notation** (`keys.py`) and not translated; everything else is.
- The saved desktop keeps the face beside the expression; an older entry without one comes back *Classic*.
- Tests: `tests/test_calculator.py`. Run a window command with `a.spawn(a.run_command(CalculatorProgramming))`;
  press a pad key with its button's `press()`.
