# Drives

DOS Navigator's panel held a **`TDrive`** (`DRIVES.PAS`): the disk, an archive (`TArcDrive`), a *Find:* listing
(`TFindDrive`), `TEMP:` (`TTempDrive`), or the PC at the other end of a cable (`TLinkDrive`, `NAVYLINK.PAS`, *Navigator
Link*, Alt+F11). `navigator/lib/drives/` is that object for a modern system. There are the disk, an in-memory drive
(the tests', later `TEMP:`), SFTP, FTP/FTPS, SMB, S3, a Docker or Podman container, an Android device over adb,
any remote `rclone config` has (`rclone://`), archives (`ARCVIEW.PAS`) and the Trash (`trash:///`). NFS is only
ever a kernel mount, which Disk > Volumes already lists. `reference/design.md` has the plan and the phases.

## Rules

- **A `Location` is not a path.** `Location(site, path, outer)`; `Location.of(Path)` for the disk,
  `Location.parse(text)` for what `str()` wrote. It has **no `__fspath__`**, so an `os.*` call handed one fails at once
  instead of running on the local disk with a remote name. `.local` is the way back, and raises `RemoteLocation` (a
  `TypeError`) off the disk. **`str()` of a local location is exactly `str(Path)`**, so histories, bookmarks and a
  saved desktop keep the same bytes; a remote one is `sftp://user@host:port/path` (`file://` parses to the disk).
- **`Panel.location` is what a panel navigates** (reactive, seeded never bound). `Panel.path` is a property: the
  `Path` on the disk, `RemoteLocation` elsewhere -- so code not yet taught about drives fails loudly. Code that works
  anywhere reads `location`, `entry_location(entry)`, `drive`, `title_location`. `local_anchor` is the last local
  directory the panel read (set in `_apply`), where it goes back when its drive closes. **A feature reachable from
  any panel reads `path` only behind an `is_local` gate** (or `_LOCAL_ONLY`/`refusal`); wanting a disk directory,
  it takes `root.on_disk(location)` when `.is_local` (a `root:` panel is the disk) and else falls back -- Alt+Del
  scans through `drive_of(location).scan`, the editor's file box (`EditWindow._start_directory`) tries the other
  panel, the edited file, home; Execute OS command gives a remote *Find:* entry by name.
- **Every `Drive` method blocks and runs on a thread** (a remote one is a round trip; a local one may be a dead
  mount). The exceptions are the existing local single-syscall ones, which stay on `location.is_local` branches
  verbatim. `change_up()` is the one drive method a handler may call on the loop: it must be lexical.
- **Failures are `OSError`** with `errno`/`filename` where known; a drive gone is `DriveGone` (`ENOTCONN`, *Remote drive
  X is not accessible* -- DN's `TLinkDrive` free-space text). `filecopy.error_message` shows any of them.
- **The local fast path is unchanged.** `LocalDrive` makes the very calls the code made before drives (`os.lstat`,
  `os.scandir`, `os.replace`, `shutil.copystat`, `statvfs`, `fsync`); the listing functions moved verbatim to
  `drives/listing.py` and `panel.py` re-exports them. A test that patched `panel_module.scan_directory` patches
  `navigator.lib.drives.listing` now.
- **One copier and one eraser for every drive.** `filecopy._Copier`/`fileerase._Eraser` ask each end's drive
  (`drive_of`) for every step; a rename between sites raises `EXDEV`, so a move between drives copies and deletes
  like a move across file systems. `filecopy.stream` is the byte loop. Questions and `done` lists carry
  `shown(location)`: the plain `Path` on the disk, the `Location` elsewhere -- so `_watch_job`, `OverwriteQuery` and
  `untag_paths` are unchanged. `resolve_target`: `://` is remote, a bare absolute path is the disk (DN: only a
  prefix left it), a relative one is on the working directory's drive.
- **Capabilities grey commands, not errors.** `Manager._LOCAL_ONLY` is **empty**: every command asks the drive or
  works on a fetched copy; it is where a new command that cannot goes until it is taught to. What a drive cannot do
  at all its capabilities grey (`enables`): rename/move/delete/mkdir/F4 need `write`, Shift+F5 needs `symlink`. File > Encoding > Checksums reads every file through `open_read`/`children`, so it needs nothing more.
- **The last ones, and how**: Shift+F4 reads its name as a copy's target line does (`target_location`: a URL, an
  archive place, or relative to the panel's drive) -- an existing file there is fetched and edited, a new one is an
  empty copy (`usefile.blank`) that F2 makes there (`$EDITOR` only for one already there). Shift+F5 makes a link on
  the destination's drive (`filelink.make_link` → `Drive.symlink`, relative by `posixpath`), only to a file on the
  same drive -- `EXDEV` otherwise -- the steps on a thread. *Make list* writes its file on the drive with that drive's
  own paths in it (`_make_list_elsewhere`); *Read file list* reads one there (`filefind.read_list_on_drive`: `/` the
  drive's top, a mask matched against a listing, `~` just a name). UU encode/decode (`Manager._staged`) fetch the
  input, write into a staging directory under `private_dir()`, and `usefile.put_files` the results up into the
  directory asked for -- its `ask` hook given those already there first, before anything is written:
  `uucode.ask_over_encoded` (anything but Yes/All abandons, as `encode` asks of the disk) and `ask_over_decoded`
  (*Check existing files*; No leaves one, Cancel it and the rest), `FileExists.path` then a `Location`. The
  dBase view fetches the file (`use_file.database_elsewhere`) and puts it back after every field edited.
- **What works anywhere, and how** (Phase 4): Alt+G counts through `Drive.children`
  (`dirlength._count_on_drive`); *Auto refresh* polls a drive with `polled = True` (SFTP, FTP, SMB) every
  *Communications* *Look for changes every* seconds (`[remote] refresh`, 0 off -- every look is traffic) through
  `base.PollWatch`, which lists on its own thread and calls only when names, sizes or times changed; Find and
  Directory branch walk the drive (`filefind._search_drive`, text by `holds_on_drive`; *disk*/*all* scopes start at
  the drive's top; links not followed), found entries carry `Location` directories (`DirEntry.path_in`,
  `listing._entry_elsewhere` re-reads them); the trees (Ctrl+T, Alt+T) root on the drive and read on threads
  (navml `TreeView.load_in_background`/`children_of`; `DirectoryTree.use_drive_of`, `show_elsewhere` walks the
  path on a thread and opens the branches when it lands; Alt+T's box makes directories through the drive);
  Ctrl+Q fetches the first `usefile.HEAD_LIMIT` (1 MiB) and shows that (`QuickViewer._show_elsewhere`); the
  information panel shows the place and `Drive.describe()` (server, host key, cipher, TLS, shares; an archive's
  kind, files, packed and unpacked) under *Connection* -- every name in `base.DESCRIBED`, which the catalogues list;
  *Compare* reads contents side by side (`dircompare.same_bytes`); *Print* spools a fetched copy; *File
  attributes* stats, chmods, chowns and utimes through the drive (`fileattr._stat`/`_children`/`_apply_elsewhere`),
  owners as numbers there (a server's ids are not this system's), changeable only where the drive can `chown`;
  the viewer's *Save as* takes a URL or an archive place (navml `FileDialog.raw`, a test for names handed back as
  typed; `viewer._save_elsewhere`, written beside and renamed over).
- **F3 reads a remote file a chunk at a time** (`viewer.ChunkedSource`), where the drive can read anywhere in it
  (`Drive.open_random` -- `SeekingReader` over a seekable `open_read` for SFTP (no `prefetch`), SMB and memory;
  `REST` + `RETR`, cut off with `ABOR`, for FTP; None for archives, which are fetched whole as before). The window
  is up at once, whatever the size. A chunk not in the cache (`REMOTE_CACHED_CHUNKS`, 32 MiB) raises **`NotYet`**
  after asking for it and `READ_AHEAD` more on the `nav-view-fetch` threads; when it lands, `arrived` tells the
  viewer (`FileViewer._chunk_arrived` → `call_from_thread` → `_chunk_landed`), which repaints and does again what
  was interrupted. **The rule that makes that safe**: every viewer method that reads is wrapped `@_when_here`
  (`seek`, `scroll_rows`, `to_end`, `show_hit`, `_snap_top`, `_to_longest_end`), and each reads everything before
  it changes anything -- so an interrupted one did nothing, and doing it again is doing it once; a caller above
  one carries on harmlessly. `render` catches `NotYet` (*Reading...*) and a failed fetch's `OSError`; `percent()`
  falls back to the offset. Search reads through the drive on its own thread (`ChunkedSource.find`, blocking);
  *Save as* streams the whole file from the drive (`stream()`); nothing is lexed (it would read everything); no
  view record is kept. A new method that reads must be wrapped the same way, or it raises `NotYet` into a handler.
- **The shell never follows a panel off the disk.** `_front_directory()` is None for a remote panel, so the subshell
  stays in its last local directory; the prompt stand-in names the panel's place (`drive.get_dir`, `SFTP:host:/path$`) and
  the shell's own prompt is hidden. `_follow_shell` moves a remote panel back to the disk only when the command
  `cd`'d (the shell's cwd changed during it) -- and never into a `UseFile` directory.
- **No secrets on disk from Navigator.** A typed password lives in the connection (`Answers`) until it closes. *Save
  in keyring* is offered only when `credentials.keyring_available()` (the `keyring` package with a real backend), and
  every keyring call is on a thread. Host keys are `ssh`'s: unknown → `HostKeyQuery` (Accept once / Save into
  `~/.ssh/known_hosts` as `[host]:port type base64`), changed → refused, no button accepts it.
- **Closing is DN's `cmCloseLinked`.** `SESSIONS.close(site, why)` unmounts the drive and tells every listener (on the
  closing thread); `Shell._heard_closed` hands it to the loop and `close_linked` sends each panel on the site to its
  `local_anchor`, saying *Remote drive X is not accessible* once for `"lost"`.

## Pieces

- **`location.py`** `Site`, `Location`, `LOCAL_SITE`, `RemoteLocation`. `normalized()` is by the letters (`..`, `.`).
- **`base.py`** `Drive` (TDrive's names: `get_dir` title, `real_name` copy target, `use_file`/`change_up`), `FileStat`
  (an `os.stat_result` look-alike; `st_dev`/`st_ino` 0 where there are none -- the copier's loop check falls back to
  site+path), capability constants, `DriveGone`.
- **`__init__.py`** `drive_of(location)` (`LOCAL` for the disk, the mounted drive for its site, else `DriveGone`),
  `mount`/`unmount`/`mounted`.
- **`memory.py`** `MemoryDrive("name")`, site `mem://name`; `make(path, data)`/`read(path)` for tests. POSIX errors where
  cheap; no owners.
- **`trash.py`** `TrashDrive`/`TRASH` on `TRASH_SITE` (`trash:///`): the freedesktop Trash
  (`navigator.lib.file_ops.trash`, `navigator-file-ops` *The Trash*). **No connection**: `drive_of` answers `TRASH`
  for the scheme without mounting and `Shell.reach` lets it through, so SESSIONS never sees it. The root lists every
  trash directory's items (a name shown already gets `.N`; `item(name)` re-reads when unknown), below it is the disk
  through `LOCAL`. Erasing only: `unlink`/`rmdir` of a root item also `forget()` its info file; making, writing,
  renaming are `EROFS`. `DirEntry.trashed` (origin, deletion time) is the panel's second info line. Watches the home
  trash's `files/`. Title `TRASH:/path`. The root lists `..` too: it and Backspace leave for
  `Panel.local_anchor`, the last local directory read (`Drive.leaves_to_anchor`, which `_go_up_elsewhere` reads where
  `change_up` answers None).
- **`sessions.py`** `SESSIONS.connect(site, answers)` (blocks; raises `NeedPassword`, `NeedPassphrase`,
  `UnknownHostKey`, `HostKeyChanged`, `DriveGone`), `close`, `close_all`, `reap(in_use, idle)`, listeners;
  `SCHEMES` (scheme → module with `available()` and `connect()`), `available(scheme)`, `EXTRA_HINT`.
- **`sftp.py`** (paramiko, the `navigator-fm[sftp]` extra, imported only when connecting). `_Connection`: one
  `SSHClient`, `~/.ssh/config` through `credentials.host_config` (hostname, user, port, IdentityFile, ProxyCommand),
  agent and keys, then the keyring's password, then the answers. A pool of ≤ `CHANNELS` `SFTPClient`s, each checked out
  by one thread (`_channel()`); a file opened keeps its channel until closed (`_HeldFile`). A watcher thread joins the
  paramiko `Transport` and, when it ends unasked, connects again once, else calls `on_lost` → `SESSIONS.close(site,
  "lost")`. `take()` makes a dropped connection again once too. Reads `prefetch()`, writes `set_pipelined(True)`;
  `replace` is `posix-rename@openssh.com`, falling back to remove+rename. `mkdir` turns SFTP v3's bare *Failure* into
  `EEXIST` when the name is there. Owners come from the server's `ls -l` line (`DirEntry.owner`).
- **`ftp.py`** (`ftp://`, `ftps://`; stdlib `ftplib`, nothing to install). `_Pool`: up to `CONNECTIONS` logged-in
  control connections, each one thread's (`FtpDrive._client()`); a file read or written (`_Transfer`, `RETR`/`STOR`/
  `APPE` over `transfercmd`) holds its connection until the reply after it. A connection is `NOOP`ed when taken and
  made again once if the server dropped it (servers drop idle ones); failing that, `on_lost`. No user is anonymous
  (empty password); a user without a password is `NeedPassword` (keyring first). Listing is `MLSD` (facts
  `type size modify unix.mode unix.owner unix.group`), else `LIST -a`, else `LIST` -- each learnt once
  (`pool.mlsd`, `pool.list_a`) -- parsed `ls -l` style (`_parse_list`); `stat` is `MLST`, else the parent's listing.
  Replies map to `OSError` (`_os_error`: 530 → `EACCES`, 550 → `ENOENT`/`EEXIST` by its words, 421 → reconnect).
  `chmod` is `SITE CHMOD` (also after `STOR` for a new file), `utime` is `MFMT`; no symlinks. FTPS is explicit
  TLS (`AUTH TLS`, `PROT P`) checked against the system's certificates. Title `FTP:host:/path`.
- **`smb.py`** (`smb://user@host/share/path`; `smbprotocol`'s `smbclient`, the `navigator-fm[smb]` extra). **The
  first name of a path is the share**; the root lists the server's disk shares, asked once per drive over RPC
  (`_ask_shares`: `smbclient.open_file("\\\\host\\IPC$\\srvsvc", mode="r+b", buffering=0, file_type="pipe")` and
  **`dcerpc.share_enum`**, a hand-written bind + `NetrShareEnum` level 1 -- smbprotocol has no RPC, impacket is
  large), `IPC$`, printers and the `$`-special ones left out, plus the shares known (the one opened on --
  `Answers.start`'s first name -- and any reached since). Any failure (guest refused, RPC off) leaves only the
  known ones, silently. `dcerpc.py` speaks to anything with `read`/`write`, keeps what one read brought past a
  fragment (`_Fragments`), and was checked against impacket's NDR (bind byte-identical, the request so but for
  referent ids, impacket's response decoded); no Samba was at hand to try it on. Each drive has its own
  `connection_cache` and passes `username`/`password`/`port` on every call; names are UNC (`_unc`). A failure of
  the connection itself (not an `OSError`) is `DriveGone`; `LogonFailure`/`AccessDenied` on connecting is
  `NeedPassword`. No user is the guest, or Kerberos with a ticket. No chmod or owners (Windows ACLs). `smb.CLIENT`
  is the module spoken through -- a test puts a stand-in there. Title `SMB:host:/share/path`.
- **`s3.py`** (`s3://[key@]endpoint[:port]/bucket/key`, `s3+http://` for plain HTTP; boto3, one of
  Navigator's own dependencies). **No new `Site` fields**: the scheme is the transport, the host the endpoint
  (`s3.amazonaws.com` / `s3.REGION.amazonaws.com` is Amazon's -- virtual-hosted, a bucket's region learnt once from
  `head_bucket`'s `x-amz-bucket-region` and a client per region; any other host an endpoint of its own by URL,
  path-style, region `us-east-1` unless `~/.aws` says), the user who (empty: the AWS chain; a `~/.aws` profile's
  name: that profile; else an access key ID whose secret is `NeedPassword`'s, keyring first). `connect` proves the
  keys with `list_buckets` (a refused one on `answers.start`'s bucket with `head_bucket`); bad keys
  (`InvalidAccessKeyId`, `SignatureDoesNotMatch`, ...) are a wrong password. **The first name is the bucket**; the
  root lists the account's buckets plus those reached by name; F7 there makes a bucket, rmdir deletes an empty one.
  **Directories are prefixes** (`list_objects_v2`, `/` delimiter, the `dir/` marker F7 leaves skipped). Writes are a
  multipart upload as they come (`_Upload`, `PART_SIZE` 8 MiB, one `put_object` when smaller; its `__exit__`
  aborts on an exception, so Stop or a failure leaves nothing); no append. A file's rename is a managed server-side
  copy and a delete; a directory's is `EXDEV`, the copier then copying and deleting. `open_random` is ranged GETs
  (F3 by chunks). No modes, owners, links or times. Unreachable after botocore's retries is `DriveGone`.
  `make_client` is the hook a test replaces. Title `S3:endpoint:/bucket/dir`; `describe` adds `Region`.
- **Containers and devices** (`execdrive.py`, `docker.py`, `podman.py`, `adb.py`; `docker://[user@]name/path`,
  `podman://...`, `adb://serial/path`). No file protocol at the other end, only `sh` and its tools (GNU, busybox,
  toybox): **every step is one process** through `ExecDrive._run` (the one seam -- a persistent shell can stand in
  later), a fixed `sh -c SCRIPT sh "$1" "$2"` script, **the paths always arguments, never written into the
  script**. `docker exec [-i] [-u USER] NAME words...` takes the words as they are; **adb joins its words into one
  line for the device's shell**, so `AdbDrive.argv` is `adb [-s SERIAL] shell -T shlex.join(words)` -- `-T` is
  shell protocol v2 without a pty: separate stdout/stderr, binary-clean, the exit status and stdin (Android 7+).
  - A listing is one `LIST` run: `stat -c STAT_FORMAT` (`%f %s %Y %X %u %g %h %i %U %G %n`, the name last) over
    the globbed names, then each link's `stat -L` and `readlink` after `LINKS_MARK`, then `df -Pk` after
    `FREE_MARK` when asked. `parse_stat` takes a line not starting with the numbers as the rest of the name before
    it (a newline in a name). A missing or unreadable directory is said in `strerror`'s words by the script
    itself, since dash's `cd` does not.
  - Failures: `os_error` finds `strerror`'s text (glibc, musl and bionic spellings) and answers the `OSError`
    subclass; else `EIO` with the words. The subclass's `lost(text, status)` says the other end is gone
    (`docker.LOST_WORDS`: *is not running*, *No such container*, the daemon; adb's *device 'x' not found*,
    *offline*, *unauthorized* → *Allow USB debugging on the device*) -- `on_lost`, then `DriveGone`.
    `docker exec`'s 126/127 *executable file not found* is *NAME has no shell (sh)*.
  - Steps: `RENAME` refuses an existing `$2` (`EEXIST`), `REPLACE` a directory there (`mv` would move into it),
    `unlink` looks first (`rm -f` says nothing of a missing file), `utime` is POSIX `TZ=UTC0 touch -a/-m -t`
    (whole seconds), `copy_attributes` mode and both times in **one** run.
  - **Data streams through pipes, not tar** (a departure from the item, recorded in the module): `open_read` is
    `cat -- path` (`_Reader`, killed on an early close, the exit status an `OSError` at EOF), `open_write` is
    `sh -c 'cat > "$1"'` (`_Writer`, the failure raised on `close`), so the copier counts per chunk, an
    overwritten file keeps its owner and inode (`docker cp`'s tar writes uid 0), and adb works the same.
    `open_random` is `tail -c +N | head -c COUNT` a chunk (F3 by chunks).
  - "Connecting" holds nothing: `docker inspect` (running? `Config.WorkingDir` is `home`, `Config.Image` for
    `describe`), `adb get-state` (`home` `/sdcard`; model and Android version by `getprop`). `polled` (Auto
    refresh looks again). Capabilities: containers write, rename, symlink, chmod, chown, free space; a device no
    symlink or chown (`/sdcard` is FUSE). Title `DOCKER:name:/path`, `ADB:serial:/path`. Names and serials keep
    their case (`location.AS_WRITTEN`); a networked serial `host:port` is the site's host and port
    (`adb.serial_of`, `Device.site`). `available()` names the missing command (`EXTRA_HINT` is the program).
    **adb off `PATH`**: Android Studio installs it in `~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools` (macOS `~/Library/Android/sdk`)
    and leaves `PATH` alone, so `adb.program()` tries `PATH`, then `$ANDROID_HOME`, `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` and those
    (`sdk_dirs`); every argv starts with `adb.command()` -- bare `adb` when `PATH` has it, else the full path (also
    `remote_shell.program("adb")` and its `adb shell -t`). conftest's `_no_android_sdk` empties `sdk_dirs` so no
    test finds the developer's SDK; the lookup's own tests put back `adb.SDK_DIRS`.
  - What is there now: `docker.list_containers(engine)` (`ps --format '{{json .}}'`, Docker's lines and
    Podman's array with `Names` a list -- `parse_ps`) and `adb.list_devices()` (`devices -l`, `parse_devices`).
- **rclone** (`rclone.py`, `rclone://REMOTE/path`; the `rclone` command, nothing to pip-install). **One
  `rclone rcd` a connection** (`Daemon`), on a Unix socket of its own (`_socket_path`: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, else
  `private_dir()`, else a `mkdtemp` -- the first whose path fits `sun_path`, `_SOCKET_LIMIT` 100; pytest's
  `tmp_path` would not) with `--rc-no-auth` (the directory, this user's alone, is the guard), `--rc-serve` and
  `--ask-password=false`, `start_new_session`. **Before 1.63** (Ubuntu 24.04's 1.60) `unix://` is taken for a
  host and port (*lookup tcp ... unknown port*, `_NO_UNIX`): started again on `127.0.0.1:0`, the port read from its
  *Serving remote control on* line (`_Log`, which reads standard error throughout and keeps it only until up), a
  random user/password in `RCLONE_RC_USER`/`RCLONE_RC_PASS` (environment, not argv) sent as basic authentication by
  `_TcpConnection.putrequest`; `_tcp_only` remembers it for the next daemon (a test resets it). Every step is a JSON POST to the rc over `_UnixConnection`
  (`operations/list`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `deletefile`, `movefile`; `sync/move` for a directory where
  `fsinfo`'s `Features.DirMove`, else `EXDEV`; `about` for the free space, `FREE_SPACE` only where
  `Features.About`); rclone's refusal (`{"error", "status"}`) is `os_error` by its words, else its status. Reads are
  `--rc-serve`'s `GET /[REMOTE:]/path` streamed (`_Body`), F3's chunks ranged GETs (`_RangeReader`; a 200 for a
  range is sliced, a 416 empty). **A write is one chunked multipart POST to `operations/uploadfile`** (`_Upload`;
  `fs`/`remote` in the query, the name in `filename*=UTF-8''`), sent as the copier writes -- rclone's `Rcat`
  reads the part as it comes; the answer read on close, an exception cuts the socket. No append, modes, owners,
  links or times (`copy_attributes` does nothing: an object's time is its upload's). **The host is the remote's
  name**, as written and percent-encoded in the URL (`location.AS_WRITTEN`; `Site.__str__` quotes such a host: a
  name may hold a space or `@`); the path is from the remote's root (`REMOTE:` + the path less its `/`) -- an
  sftp/local remote's root is where its config says, so the real-rclone test uses an `alias`. An **encrypted
  config** is `NeedPassword` (rcd ends at once with *RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS*/*decrypt* words, `wants_password`;
  `wrong` when one was given), given only in the daemon's environment, kept in the keyring under `Site("rclone")`
  (one config, one password); `Shell.reach` asks it as *Password for rclone's configuration*. A daemon gone is
  started again once silently (`_revive`), else `on_lost` → `DriveGone`. `connect` asks `fsinfo` (features; *didn't
  find section in config file* is no such remote -- not `config/listremotes`, which leaves out a remote set up in
  the environment), `config/get` for its backend, else `RCLONE_CONFIG_NAME_TYPE`. `describe`: *Remote*, *Backend*, *Software*,
  *Hashes*. Title `RCLONE:name:/path`. **Its link manager** (Utilities > Link > *~r~clone remote...*,
  `RcloneLink`) is **live**: *── Configured ──* over `rclone listremotes --long` (`list_remotes`/
  `parse_listremotes`, on a thread); `_entry` takes the *Re~m~ote* line whole (no `split_host`: an `@` is the
  name's), no user or port; *Confi~g~ure...* (`configure`, rclone's only) closes the box with
  `ConnectRequest(configure=True)` and `Shell.configure_rclone` runs `rclone config` in a window that stays.
  `ConnectDialog` (F2 in the Link box, *Saved links*) has *~R~emote* likewise. No Remote shell entry: there is
  nothing to run there.
- **Each protocol is named and has its own entry**, all in Utilities > **Lin~k~ ▸** (`utilities_link`; a
  departure, asked for: one entry a protocol, grouped, no box first asking which): *SSH (SFTP)...* (Alt+F11,
  `NavyLink`), *FTP...* (`FtpLink`), *SMB (Windows share)...* (`SmbLink`), *S3 (Amazon S3)...* (`S3Link`),
  *GVfs/KIO...* (`GvfsLink`), *Docker container...* (`DockerLink`), *Podman container...* (`PodmanLink`),
  *Android device (adb)...* (`AdbLink`), each `Shell.navy_link(panel, scheme=)`; the
  `ConnectDialog(scheme=)` is that protocol's (`titles(scheme)`), FTP's with *Encrypt with TLS (FTPS)* (`secure`,
  the scheme then `ftps`), SMB's *Directory* captioned *Share/dir* (a share typed without `/` is made `/share`),
  S3's *Endpoint* (opening on `s3.amazonaws.com`), *Access key* and *Bucket/dir*, its `secure` box *Encrypt with
  TLS (HTTPS)* (unticked: `s3+http`); `reach()` asks S3's password as *Secret key for ...*.
  The recent list is the protocol's (`recent.recent(("ftp", "ftps"))` for FTP's box). The Link list has a *New ...
  link* per protocol (its mapping is the scheme), each greyed with its extra when missing. `sessions.PROTOCOLS`
  names them all.
- **SSH extras**: `ProxyJump` in `~/.ssh/config` (`a,b`, `user@host:port`, `ssh://` hops; `credentials.jump_site`)
  is `HostConfig.jumps`, and `_Connection.open` chains them natively: each hop logged into by `_login` (its own
  `host_config`; the first hop's own `ProxyCommand` honoured, a hop's own `ProxyJump` not followed), the next one
  reached over its `direct-tcpip` channel (`_forward`), the server last. Every hop's host key, password and
  passphrase are asked as the server's are, the question's `hop` naming it (`(host, port)`, None for the server)
  and its answer kept in `Answers.for_hop(hop)`; a jump host's password is saved to the keyring at once, the
  server's by `connect`. The hops' clients are `_Connection.chain`, closed after the server's in reverse; `_watch`
  watches only the last transport (a dying hop ends it, and the one reconnect rebuilds the chain). An explicit
  `ProxyCommand` still wins, through `paramiko.ProxyCommand`. **Keyboard-interactive** (a one-time
  code, a PIN): `Answers.interactive` -- set by `Shell.reach` (`_interactive_asker`) -- is called on the connecting
  thread with the server's prompts and waits while the loop shows a box per prompt (masked unless the server says
  echo), as a copy's worker waits for its questions; tried after a password fails or when there is nothing else to
  try. paramiko's own fallback for a second factor after a key, `auth_interactive_dumb`, reads **stdin** -- the
  screen -- so `connect` is given a `transport_factory` whose `Transport` routes it through `interactive` too.
  Cancelling a prompt is `DriveGone` ("Cancelled"), not a password box.
  **Port forwards** (a departure, asked for: DN's cable had no ports): `forwards.py`. A connection's are
  `RemoteProfile.forwards`, one a line in `ssh`'s words (`L [bind:]port:host:hostport`, `R ...`, `D [bind:]port`;
  `[v6]` bracketed, `/` for `:` too, `#` comments), `Forward`/`parse(strict=)`/`render`/`describe`/`ssh_words`.
  **Both ends use them**: Remote shell's `ssh` gets `-L/-R/-D` after the connection's options
  (`remote_shell.command(..., forwards)`), and an SFTP panel's paramiko connection opens them while it is up --
  `Answers.forwards` → `_Connection.forwards` → `Tunnels(transport, ...)` at the end of **every** `open()` (so the
  one silent reconnect reopens them; `close()` stops them first). `L`/`D` are a listening socket here
  (`create_server`, the loopback unless a bind is named, `*` every address; accept loops poll `POLL` for the stop
  flag -- closing a socket does not wake `accept()` on Linux) and a `direct-tcpip` channel a connection; `D` first
  reads SOCKS 4/4a/5 (`socks_request`, no auth, CONNECT only). `R` is `transport.request_port_forward` -- paramiko
  keeps **one handler for all of them**, so `_arrived` tells them apart by the server's port. Each pair is pumped by
  one thread over a selector. A forward that cannot open (port taken, server refusing) is in `Tunnels.opened`'s
  `error`, never raised; the info panel's *Forward* lines (`base.DESCRIBED`) show each, with its bound port and any
  error. Which forwards: `Shell.reach(target, forwards=None)` -- the link manager passes the lines' (`[]` for a
  one-off), anything else (Link box, saved desktop, `nav sftp://`) `profiles.forwards_for(site)`, the first
  profile by `seq` for that scheme/user/host/port. Forwards only open with a **new** connection: one already up
  keeps what it has. `profiles.save`/`replace` take `forwards=None` to keep a row's own, as `options`.
  `tests/sftp_server.py` answers `tcpip-forward` (`check_port_forward_request`) when `forwarding=True`.
  **Copy key** (`ssh-copy-id`): the SSH manager's *Copy ~k~ey...* picks `credentials.public_keys()` (`~/.ssh/*.pub`,
  `DEFAULT_KEYS` first; several: a `PopupMenu`; none: asks to make `id_ed25519` with `ssh-keygen` first), settles a
  changed connection, then **closes the box** with a `ConnectRequest(copy_key=, generate_key=)` -- a command window
  is the desktop's and the desktop is under every dialog, so it cannot open over the box -- and
  `Shell.copy_ssh_key` runs `remote_shell.copy_id_command` in a window that stays (`closes=False`), where `ssh` asks
  the password. Only `-o`, `-F` and `-J` (as `-o ProxyJump=`) of the options reach `ssh-copy-id`. Needs no paramiko;
  refused with a note when `ssh-copy-id` is missing (`remote_shell.copy_id_program`).
- **`credentials.py`** `host_config`, `fingerprint` (`SHA256:...`), `save_host_key`, `keyring_available`,
  `saved_password`/`save_password`/`forget_password` (service `navigator-fm`, account `str(site)`).
- **`profiles.py`** over `navigator/models/remote_profile/` (`remote_profiles`: name unique, scheme, host, port, user,
  path, seq). `location_of(profile)`; a path of `.` (`profiles.HOME`) opens on the server's home (`drive.home`).
  **Utilities > *Saved links*** (`EditLinks`, `Shell.edit_links`; also *Edit links...* at the foot of the *Link*
  list, `link_section`'s `EDIT_LINKS`) is `widgets/drives/links_dialog`: the profiles copied in as
  `profiles.Entry`s (`entries()`), edited -- F2/*Edit* and Ins/*Add* (a protocol menu first; *New GVfs/KIO link* asks the URI
  first, `navigator-gio` skill) in `ConnectDialog(editing=True)`, Del/*Delete* asked, Ctrl+Up/Down moved (its `LinkList` lets those keys past the
  list to the `links_dialog` key table) -- and written back on OK in one transaction (`profiles.store`: gone names
  deleted, `seq` the list's order); Cancel changes nothing; *Connect* stores, then `go_remote`s the active panel.
- **`recent.py`** over `navigator/models/recent_link/` (`recent_links`: scheme, host, user, port, path, seq; unique
  by scheme+host+user+port, the directory the last one used). The SSH link box's Host `▐↓▌` drops these as
  `choices`, not a `HistoryEntry` list: `ConnectDialog` replaces its `host.history.choose`, so a pick fills host,
  login, port and directory together. `Shell.navy_link` remembers a connection only once it worked. As long as
  Interface's *History size*.
- **`archive.py`** DN's `TArcDrive` (`ARCVIEW.PAS`): `ArchiveDrive` over `zipfile`/`tarfile` (any compression
  `tarfile.open` reads), and over **`arctool.ToolArchive`** for 7z and rar, told by signature (`arctool.kind_of`):
  7-Zip's command line (`7zz`, `7z`, `7za` -- no rar codec in `7za`), and for rar **`unrar` first** (`tool_for`;
  7-Zip 23's codec decrypts no encrypted rar -- *Unsupported Method* -- and fails `7z t` on a rar5 symlink), 7-Zip
  the fallback; listed with `7z l -slt -ba` (`parse_slt`; `unrar lta -c-`, `parse_unrar`, which skips `Type:
  Service` blocks -- `QO`, the quick-open record a larger rar carries, would otherwise list as a file), each member
  read through a pipe from `7z x -so -spd --` (`-spd`: a name is never a wildcard; `_Piped` kills the tool on an
  early close and turns its exit status into `OSError`), links' targets read as their contents -- except where the
  listing names them (`ToolInfo.target`: unrar's `Target:`, 7-Zip's `Symbolic Link` for a rar; `unrar p` prints a
  link as nothing and `7z x -so` fails on one). Nothing bundled:
  no tool is **`NeedsTool`** (a `NotAnArchive`), which Enter says rather than running the file. A 7z is rewritten by
  `_write_tool` -- the old one unpacked once into a tree (solid blocks are whole), the index laid out over it, packed
  anew by `arctool.write_archive` (`7z a -snl`, `-mx<level>`); `.7z` is in `NEW_KINDS`. **Passwords** (7z and zip,
  7-Zip only): `ToolArchive(local, kind, password)` gives 7-Zip the password **on stdin, never `-p<pw>`** (which `ps`
  shows) -- no `-p` at all, `start_new_session` so it has no terminal to ask on, the password and a newline as input;
  `write_archive` passes a bare `-p` (it then reads the password twice) with `-mhe=on` (7z: names too) or
  `-mem=AES256` (zip). unrar is fed the same way (no `-p-` any more); a wrong password makes it ask again and,
  its input spent, abort with **255**, a missing one with encrypted names exit **11** -- both are refusal
  (`_refused`), and a file-only encrypted rar (`Flags: encrypted`) is checked with `unrar t` on its smallest file.
  **Writing a rar** is RARLAB's `rar` (not free, never required; `arctool.rar_program`): `write_rar` -- `rar a -r
  -ol -y -idq -m<0..5>`, `-hp` with the password twice on stdin (names encrypted too), the target unlinked first
  (rar adds to what is there); an empty tree is refused (`ENOTSUP`), since rar deletes an archive emptied of its last
  member. Without `rar` a rar is read-only (`capabilities` empty) and RAR is greyed in *Create archive* (*RAR needs
  rar*). A wrong or missing one is `arctool.NeedPassword` → **`archive.NeedPassword`** (a
  `NotAnArchive`): listing fails with *Wrong password* (encrypted names), or a member says `Encrypted = +`
  (`ToolInfo.encrypted`) and `7z t` on the smallest fails. A zip with an encrypted member (`flag_bits & 1`) is read
  through `ToolArchive(kind="zip")` -- `ArchiveDrive.tool` is which back-end, `kind` stays `zip` -- and rewritten by
  `_write_tool` with its password, so it stays encrypted; a password given for an archive that is not encrypted is
  dropped (`_load`). `widgets/drives/archives.open_archive_or_root` asks it (`ask_archive_password`, a
  `PasswordDialog`), again after a wrong one; Cancel is `Stopped`, never the `NotAnArchive` that would run the file.
  **`.tar.zst`** (`zstd.py`): `compression.zstd` (3.14+) else the `zstd` command, neither is `NeedsTool`; `tarfile`
  wants to seek, so `_open` decompresses it whole into a private `.tar` (`ArchiveDrive._plain`, deleted on close and
  on re-reading) and `_write_tar` writes a plain tar and compresses it (`--ultra` above 19). A rar is writable only where `rar` is installed. `_Member.packed`/`DirEntry.packed` carry the packed size (a zip's `compress_size`, 7-Zip's *Packed
  Size* -- blank for a solid block's later members; None for a tar). A place in one is `Location(Site("arc"), inner, outer=<the archive's location>)` -- `outer`
  is DN's `Prev` -- printing as `/dir/a.zip#/inner`; `Location.parse` reads that back when the name before `#/` is in
  the *archive* file type (`a.zip#//` is the root too), and so does the copy target line (`filecopy.target_location`).
  `drive_of` finds it by its `outer` (`archive.find`). `open_archive(outer, job, create=)` reads the whole index (a
  compressed tar: the whole file), fetching one on another drive first (`UseFile`; the copy goes with the drive).
  Implied directories are listed; a tar's owners are `uname:gname`; links are followed inside the archive; devices,
  FIFOs and hard links in a tar are not listed (and a rewrite drops them). Reads share one file, one at a time
  (`_Locked`). Title `ZIP:a.zip:/inner` (`get_dir`, DN's `ZIP:C:A.ZIP\INNER`). `..` is always listed; at the root
  `change_up` is `(outer.parent, outer.name)`, so the cursor lands on the archive.
- **The read-only kinds and the single compressed file** (none DN's; `members.py`'s `ListedArchive`, the
  shape `ToolArchive` has -- `infolist()` of `ToolInfo` (now with `owner`, and `ref`, the back-end's handle),
  `open(info)`, `read_link`, `details()` for `describe`, `close()` -- so `ArchiveDrive.listed` indexes and reads
  them as it does 7-Zip's). `_open` tries, by content: 7z/rar; **squashfs** (`squashfs.offset_of`: `hsqs` at 0,
  or a type 2 **AppImage** -- `AI\x02` at ELF byte 8, the image at `e_shoff + e_shentsize*e_shnum`) through
  `unsquashfs` (`-lls -full -UTC -d ''`, `parse_lls`; a file read by `-no-wildcards [-o OFF] -cat` through a
  pipe, extracted to a private directory before squashfs-tools 4.6 had `-cat`; missing is `NeedsTool`
  *install squashfs-tools*); **`ar`** (`debpkg.parse_ar`, GNU and BSD names) -- a **deb** when `debian-binary`
  is there, laid out as `dpkg-deb -R` unpacks it (data at the root, the control tar under `DEBIAN/`, each tar
  decompressed whole into a private plain one; hard links listed, read as their target; `Package` from
  `control`), else the raw members (`ArArchive`, a `.a`); **rpm** (`rpmpkg`: lead, signature header padded to 8,
  header -- NAME/VERSION/RELEASE/ARCH for `Package` -- then the payload by magic, gz/bz2/xz/lzma/zst/none,
  decompressed into a private cpio; rpm 4.12's stripped `07070X` is `NeedsTool`); **cpio** (`cpio.parse`:
  newc, crc, odc, old binary either order; members read by `members.window`'s `pread`; a `newc` hard-link
  group reads the name that has the bytes; devices and FIFOs not listed); then a **compressed** file: a tar as
  before, a cpio (`.cpio.gz`, an initramfs, decompressed to a plain one), else **one compressed file**
  (`stream.py`, kind `STREAM`: one member named as gunzip names it, `member_name`; its size counted by one
  pass on opening; `sign` the compression's, `GZ:app.log.gz:/`). `READ_ONLY_KINDS` (deb, rpm, cpio,
  squashfs, ar) have no capabilities and every mutator is `EROFS` (`_refuse`: a target line can still name
  one). A `STREAM` has `write` only: its one member may be written over (F4's F2 -- `usefile.upload` writes
  straight over it, there being no `rename`) and `utime`d, and `finish` compresses it anew the same way
  (`_write_stream`, `stream.writer`, zst through `zstd.compress`); anything else is `EROFS`. The decompressing
  passes take the opening's `job` (`members.stopped_check`). `*.squashfs;*.sqfs` joined the *archive* file
  type; **`*.appimage` did not**, so Enter still runs one -- **Ctrl+PgDn** (`GoInto`, DN's `_CtrlPgDn`: a
  directory, `..` and a *Find:* entry as Enter; on a file, which DN's left alone, a departure) and File >
  Archive > *Open archive* (`OpenArchive`, `Panel.open_as_archive`, a regular file outside an archive) open
  any file by its content, `enter_archive(forced=True)` saying *{name} is not an archive Navigator can read*
  rather than running it. `tests/test_archive_formats.py` builds every kind in the test (squashfs with
  `mksquashfs`, skipped without squashfs-tools).
- **Writing an archive is a rewrite** (DN's packers rewrote too) **at a level**: `ArchiveDrive.level` (one of
  `LEVEL_NAMES`: store/fastest/normal/maximum/ultra, `normal` unless *Create archive* said) is
  `LEVELS[(kind, compression)]` to each writer -- deflate level (*store* = `ZIP_STORED`, new members only; old
  ones keep theirs), gzip/bz2 `compresslevel` (bz2's is only its block size), xz `preset` (*ultra* `|
  PRESET_EXTREME`), zstd level, 7-Zip `-mx`; a level a format has not got is missing (no *store* for a compressed
  tar), a plain tar has none. `ArchiveOptions(level, password)` rides on `CopyRequest.archive` into
  `_open_target_archive`, which also sets the level on one there already. every step -- `open_write`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`,
  `unlink`, `rename`/`replace`, `symlink`, `chmod`, `utime` -- changes the in-memory index under `_tree`, a new file's
  bytes staged in `private_dir()/archive/<pid>/`; **`Drive.finish()`** (a no-op elsewhere) writes the whole archive
  anew beside it (`.name.XXXX`), each zip member keeping its compression, a tar its compression (`_compression_of`,
  by magic bytes) and owners, then `os.replace`s it over, re-reads it, and for a fetched one uploads it back.
  **`finish(job)`** counts the packing into a copy's job (`total_bytes`/`done_bytes`, `source` the member,
  `file_bytes`/`file_done`) and raises `Stopped` between chunks -- the temp file removed, the archive as it was;
  **`discard()`** drops the unwritten changes (index re-read, staging deleted). The copier sets `job.packing` (and
  `dest` the archive) around `finish_drives(..., job=)` for a target in an archive: the progress box says *Packing*;
  Stop there discards (`filecopy.discard_drives`) and reports nothing done. **A move into an archive holds each
  source's removal** (`_Copier._held`, `_remove_source`) until the archive is written and not `dirty`
  (`_remove_held`) -- a pack that fails or is stopped loses nothing; before, sources went as each file was staged.
  **Whoever makes the steps calls `finish` once at the end**: the copier and eraser (`filecopy.finish_drives` over
  sources and target, also after Stop -- what went in full stays), `Manager.make_directory`/`_rename_entry`, and
  `usefile.upload` (the editor's F2). A copy whose target names an archive not open opens it, or -- named but not
  there, with a name in `NEW_KINDS` -- makes an empty one (DN's `ArchiveFiles`, packing by the target's name), and
  lets go of it after (`release_unheld`). **On another drive too**: `open_archive(create=True)` on a remote name not
  there makes it in a private copy (`usefile.blank`, the file removed so the first `finish` makes it) and `finish`
  puts it there (`_put_back`). A panel holds the archive it is in (`Panel._hold_archive`;
  `archive.hold`/`leave`), the last one out closes it on a thread (which finishes first); `Navigator.on_stop` closes
  the rest.
  **Changes a rewrite could not make are never dropped unasked.** `dirty` is `_dirty or _unsent` -- `_unsent` an
  archive from another drive rewritten here whose `_put_back` failed (a later `finish` only uploads); `discard()`
  clears both. `archive.pending()` lists the open dirty ones. `navigator/widgets/drives/archive_finish.py`:
  `finish_pending(app, drives)` writes each under a progress box and on failure asks *Try again?* (Yes again, As root
  first for a refusal on the disk, No `discard`s, Cancel stops); Alt+X's `_quit_asking` runs it over `pending()`
  after the windows (Cancel stays), and a panel letting go of a dirty archive spawns `let_go` (Cancel:
  `archive.keep_open`, held by no one, so quitting asks again; no loop running: kept for `close_all`). `close()`
  logs a failed `finish` to `errors.log` (`errorlog.append(error, context)`) -- only a non-interactive exit gets there.
- **Entering**: Enter (`Panel.choose` → `_may_enter_archive`) with File Manager Setup's *Enter opens an archive*
  (`enter_opens_archive`, DN's `fmoEnterArchives`), on a file the *archive* file type names, from a panel not in an
  archive (DN opened none from inside another): `widgets/drives/archives.enter_archive` opens it under *Reading
  archive*; `NotAnArchive` (a `.zip` that is not, a `.deb`) runs it as a file instead, as `ArcViewer`
  failing fell through to `ExecFile`. The name test is a departure: DN tried every file by signature, which would
  take a `.docx` (a zip) in. Inside one, F5/F6/F8/F7/rename/F4 work as anywhere; no bookmark or quick directory is
  kept there, history skips it, and a saved desktop keeps the archive's directory with the cursor on it.
- **Extract to, Test, Shift+F2** (`ARCVIEW.PAS` `HandleCommand`/`ExtractFiles`, `FLPANELX.PAS` `cmExtractArchive`):
  File > Archive > *Extract to...* (`ExtractTo`, cmExtractTo) and *Test archive* (`ArcTest`, cmArcTest), enabled only in an
  archive; Files > *Extract archive...* (`ExtractArchive`, Shift+F2) only outside one, on archive-type files.
  `ExtractDialog` is `dlgExtract` (*Extract to* on the Copy history, *Extract with path names* ticked, *Test only*,
  Tree) less *Password* (zipfile knows only ZipCrypto); an empty line is the archive's own directory. Extracting is
  the copier (`Manager._extract` → `_run_copy`), the Copy dialog's session mode and options, without paths
  `CopyRequest.flatten` (`_Copier._flattened`: every file under a directory into the target). Shift+F2 opens each
  archive on a thread, extracts its root's children, then `release_unheld`. Test is **`ArchiveDrive.test(job,
  locations)`**: every member read through (zip CRCs, tar reads; 7z `7z t`, rar `unrar t`, whole), `(path, why)` per failure,
  said in a box. **Departure, recorded**: DN put Extract/Test/Password on F4/F6/F7 of an archive panel's key bar
  (`hcArchives`); here F4 and F6 stay Edit and Rename/Move, which work in an archive.
  **Shift+F2 extracts everywhere** (a departure, asked for): outside an archive it is *Extract archive*, inside one
  `Manager.on_extract_archive` runs *Extract to...* -- so File > Archive > *Extract to...* shows Shift-F2 as a static key (the
  binding is `ExtractArchive`'s). The panel's right-click menu offers *Extract to...* and *Test archive* in an
  archive, and *Extract archive...* on an archive file outside one (`panel._archive_file`). **Shift+F1, File > *Create
  archive...*** (`ArchiveFiles`, `cmPanelArcFiles`; DN's caption *Copy to archive*, renamed -- a departure, asked
  for; *Compare files* moved to `~l~` to free the `i`) is **`ArchiveDialog`** (`widgets/file_ops/archive_dialog`,
  DN's `dlgArchiveFiles`, 64x18): *Archive to* (Copy's history), *Archive type* (`FORMATS`: ZIP 7Z TAR TAR.GZ
  TAR.BZ2 TAR.XZ TAR.ZST RAR), *Compression* (None/Fastest/Normal/Maximum/Ultra; *None* is `store`), *Password*,
  *Store pathnames* (off = `CopyRequest.flatten`), *Move files*, *Follow symlinks*, Tree (keeps the name). The type
  and the name's ending follow each other (`_kind_changed`/`_name_changed` effects); levels and password a type
  has not got are greyed (`RadioButtons.enable_mask`, navml's `TCluster.EnableMask`); a type with no tool
  (`archive.format_missing`) is greyed and said on the row above the buttons. OK (`confirm`): a name with no ending
  gets the type's, a password is asked again (`dlgReenterPassword`), an existing file is *Add to it* / *Replace*
  (`ask_add_or_replace`; existence asked on a thread); type, level and boxes are remembered for the session, never
  the password. The request is a copy (`Manager.archive_files` → `_run_copy`, mode *Ask*) into the archive's root,
  which the copy makes; `Manager._archive_place`: named after the one entry (its archive ending, else its last
  extension, dropped), else the directory; in the other panel's place when it can be written (never inside an
  archive), else this one's -- any drive. Departures: today's formats for DN's ARC..ZOO, *Store*/*Ultra* added, no
  *Additional options* or *Force mode* (no per-format archiver to pass them to), *Follow symlinks* added.
- **Archive columns** (`TArcDrive.Init`'s `ColumnsDefaults.Arc`): `Panel.archive_columns`, seeded from *Column
  defaults*' *Archives* (`[column_defaults] arc_*`) each time an archive is entered (`_hold_archive`), is
  `shown_columns` in an archive; `packed` (*Packed*, `display_packed`) and `ratio` (*%*, `display_ratio`, DN's
  `Percent(Size, PSize)`, 100 for an empty file) count only there (`Panel.ARCHIVE_ONLY`) and drop before the path
  and date. Alt+K in an archive is `dlgArcParms`' boxes (`ColumnsDialog(archive=True)`); *Full* is `ALL_COLUMNS`.
- **Not done, on purpose**: a symbolic link from one drive to another (Shift+F5 across drives is `EXDEV`) -- a path
  on one drive means nothing on another, and DN had no such thing.
- **`usefile.py`** DN's `UseFile`: `fetch(origins, job)` into `private_dir()/remote/<pid>/<site-hash>/<mkdtemp>/`,
  `changed`, `conflicts` (the original changed since), `upload` (written beside as `.name.nav-XXXXXX`, chmod, `replace`
  over), `discard`, `sweep` (dead processes' directories, at start, on a thread; nothing is made just to look).
  `changed` compares size and `mtime_ns`, and the copy keeps the original's time -- so a copy whose recorded time is
  within `RACY_NS` (2 s) of the moment it was recorded also keeps a SHA-256 (`_stamp`, git's "racy" case), compared
  when size and time agree: a same-size write in the same clock tick was once missed (and `test_elevate` flaked).
- **Loop side** `navigator/widgets/drives/`: `use_file.py` (`materialize`, `put_back` under `[remote] upload_changed`
  ask/always/never, `view_elsewhere`, `edit_elsewhere`), `connect_dialog` (`ConnectRequest`, `split_host`),
  `password_dialog` (navml `InputLine.password`: stars, nothing copied), `host_key_query` ("once"/"save"/None).
- **`Shell`**: `reach(location)` (the connect loop: progress box, then each question, retried), `go_remote(panel,
  location)`, `navy_link(panel)`, `hang_up()`, `close_linked`, `reap_connections` (Navigator's `call_every(60)`),
  `_use_panel_files`/`_open_elsewhere`/`_put_back` (Enter, F2's menu and associations on fetched copies; `run_command`
  takes `cwd=` and `uses=`, which `command_finished` offers back). `Navigator.on_stop` closes every connection.
- **`Manager`**: `link_section(menu, before=toggle)` in the bookmark box -- the bookmarks' keys act on a profile
  there (`_profile_key`): F2 edits it (`ConnectDialog(editing=True)`: saved through `profiles.replace`, never
  connected, no paramiko needed), Del removes it unasked, Ctrl+Up/Down `profiles.move` it; the box opens again
  with *Link* dropped on the same row (navml `PopupMenu(submenu=(index, current))`); with any profile there, the
  key bar says *F2 Edit*, *Del Delete*, *Ctrl+↑↓ Move* while the list is open (`SubMenu.hints`; `Up/Down` in the ASCII tier); `_go_to` connects a URL through
  `app.shell.reach`; F3/F4/Alt+F3/Alt+F4/`$PAGER`/`$EDITOR` fetch first. `EditWindow.use_set`: F2 writes the copy and
  `put_back(ask=False)`; the title names the origin; no edit record; closing discards. `FileWindow.use_set` the same.
  **A copy that did not go back is unsaved.** `put_back` is True only when the drive has the copy (sent, or nothing
  changed); False -- failed (said), declined, a clash refused, stopped, `never` -- sets the window's `unsent`
  (`EditWindow` reactive: title marked, `must_ask`, Save all and F3's load ask; `FileWindow`/`DBWindow` plain, hex
  Shift+F2 and a field edit). Closing then asks `offer_upload` (Yes tries again and stays on failure, No drops the
  copy, Cancel stays); a retry is sent because `_stamp` moves only on success. F3 loading another file into a
  remote editor lets its copy go. `Shell._put_back` (programs) still discards after saying a failure.
- **Commands** `NavyLink` (Utilities > *Link* > *SSH (SFTP)...*, Alt+F11 -- DN's *Navigator Link*, renamed for its
  protocol), `HangUp` (*Disconnect*, Alt+H; greyed with
  nothing mounted), `SetupLink` (Options > Configuration > *Communications...* → `CommunicationsPage`, `[remote]`
  keepalive, timeout, idle_disconnect, upload_changed, ssh_options).
- **The link managers** (`navigator/widgets/drives/link_manager/`, `LinkManagerDialog(family=...)`, after
  FileZilla's Site Manager; a departure, asked for): one a protocol, one component. Each Utilities > *Link* entry
  opens its family's (`Shell.link_manager(panel, family)`; `navy_link` with no request and `gvfs_link` go there, so
  the Link box's *New ... link* items do too); each Utilities > *Remote shell* entry opens its family's in
  `mode="shell"`. Each lists only its family's profiles (`entries_for(family)`, read
  on a thread by the caller; `family_of(scheme)` maps back), the lines on the right under `ConnectDialog`'s ids,
  *Name* (`label`) on top, then `host`, `user`, `port`, `directory`. `FAMILIES` and `_dress()` hold what differs:
  - `sftp` -- as below; histories `ssh_*`. `ftp` -- lists `ftp`/`ftps`; the `secure` box (*Encr~y~pt with TLS
    (FTPS)*) is the scheme, unticked to start. `smb` -- *Sh~a~re/dir*, a leading `/` added (`rooted`). `s3` --
    lists `s3`/`s3+http`; *End~p~oint* (one-off and New start at `AWS_HOST`), *Access ~k~ey*, *~B~ucket/dir*
    (rooted), the box (*HTTPS*) ticked to start. `gvfs` -- the backend's `link_schemes()` less Navigator's own
    (`schemes_of`): *Name* and a `uri` line alone (`uri_of`/`Location.parse` both ways; status line moved up);
    `problem()` refuses a URI nothing reaches with the old *is no place GVfs/KIO reaches* strings; *New* cannot
    keep an empty place (no scheme, so in no list): from a chosen one it starts a one-off to type the URI into.
    `docker`/`podman` -- *Cont~a~iner*, *Use~r~* (`exec -u`), no port. `adb` -- *Se~r~ial*, no user, the port a
    networked serial's. These three are **live** (`Family.live`): below the kept rows a heading (*── Running ──*,
    *── Connected ──*) and what is there now (`live_targets(family)`, read on a thread when the box mounts and on
    Ctrl+R, `ReadLiveLinks`; a failure or nothing there goes on the status line). Rows past `len(entries)` are
    reached only through `_live_at(row)`: choosing one fills the lines as a one-off (`_fill_live`, `chosen`
    None), *New* keeps it, *Connect* or a double click goes there; the heading does nothing; Delete and `_settle`
    never see them. An empty *Directory* opens on the drive's `home`.
  - The box's state is in `_values()` (so ticking it is a change) and decides the scheme written; histories are
    `{family}_name`... (`gvfs_uri` for the URI). `missing` is `sessions.available` of the family's first scheme.
  - SSH's adds two buttons under *ssh options*, *~F~orwards...* (`ForwardsDialog`/`ForwardDialog` in
    `widgets/drives/forwards_dialog/`; the text is `forwards_text`, part of `_values()` so an edit is *changed*;
    the caption counts them, `~F~orwards ({n})...` set from Python with the markup's letter) and *Copy ~k~ey...*;
    the status line moves to y=15, one row, for SSH.
  - Captions set from Python (*Sh~a~re/dir*, *End~p~oint*...) are not in `tools/i18n.py check`'s clash check,
    which reads markup: their letters were picked by hand against the box's (N H L o D S w e t C, and each
    language's own). Its method for that is `problem()`, never `refusal()`, which is navkit's command hook.
  **Two states**, `chosen`:
  - **None: a one-off connection**, how it opens (keyboard on Name; the list shows no cursor unfocused), and after
    *Delete*. *Connect* uses the lines; *Save*/*Delete* greyed; the line under says *Not saved -- New keeps it*.
  - **A connection chosen** -- the cursor moved onto a row (effect `_follow_cursor`), or a click or Space on one,
    even the cursor's (`saved_list.py`'s `SavedList.on_choose`): the lines *are* it. A **double click** connects
    (`SavedList.on_activate` → `_activate`, only once the row is the chosen one: a double click away from a changed
    connection only asks). **Changed** while they differ
    from `_baseline`: the row says `name *`, *Save* (F2) lights up. Save is `profiles.replace` (renamed in place;
    another connection's name is refused in the status line, no prompt). **Leaving a changed one asks** *Save
    changes to "x"?* Yes/No/Cancel (`_settle()`): choosing another row (the cursor is put back meanwhile), *New*,
    *Connect*, *Cancel*, Esc (`must_ask`/`ask_to_close`).
  - *New* (Ins): kept at once and chosen, Name focused with its text selected -- the one-off lines if a host is
    typed, else empty under *New connection* (`unique_name()`: *New connection 2*...). *Delete* (Del) asks.
  - `_follow_lines` (effect) **reads all five values first, every run**: an effect depends only on what its last
    run read, and one that short-circuited on `chosen is None` at mount never ran again (found by a test).
    A button's note (`_say`) outranks the state text until the lines change from `_noted`.
  - **Every line has a history** (`history_id` `ssh_name`/`ssh_host`/`ssh_login`/`ssh_port`/`ssh_directory`),
    recorded (`record_history()`) on *Connect*, *Save* and *New* -- the box closes by its own `close()`, never
    `on_ok_click`, so it records itself. Host remembers only hosts, as the others do: not `ConnectDialog`'s
    recent whole connections (`choices`), which the saved list on the left stands for here. `recent.remember`
    still runs after a connection that worked.
  - A `user@host:port` typed in Host wins over Login/Port. *Connect* (default) answers a `ConnectRequest`;
    `missing` (no paramiko) blocks it only in `mode="panel"`. **Nothing is taken from the panel** (asked for: a
    box whose contents follow what the panel shows is implicit behaviour): it always opens on a one-off.
    FTP/SMB/S3/GVfs, the Link box's F2 and *Saved links* keep `ConnectDialog` (which has *~C~ontainer*/*~U~ser*
    and *~S~erial* for the new three).
- **Remote shell** (Utilities > **Rem~o~te shell ▸**, `utilities_shell`: *SSH...* `Terminal` -- DN's `cmTerminal`,
  the modem terminal, which stood before *Hang up* -- *Docker container...* `DockerShell`, *Podman container...*
  `PodmanShell`, *Android device (adb)...* `AdbShell`; no keys): `navigator/lib/drives/remote_shell.py`.
  `Shell.open_remote_shell(family)` opens that family's manager in `mode="shell"`, never prefilled from the
  panel; *Connect* brings forward a still-running `TerminalWindow` whose `remote_site` is the site chosen (DN's
  `OpenTerminal`, `Term^.Select`), else runs `command()` through `run_in_window(closes=remote_shell.closes(scheme),
  title=remote_shell.title(site))` and remembers it in `recent`. SSH's is `ssh -t [-p PORT] [-l USER] -- HOST
  'cd DIR 2>/dev/null; exec "${SHELL:-/bin/sh}" -l'` (no `cd` for the home directory, `.`), `shlex`-quoted twice;
  a container's `ENGINE exec -it [-u USER] [-w DIR] NAME sh -c 'exec "${SHELL:-/bin/sh}" -l'`; a device's
  `adb [-s SERIAL] shell -t ['cd DIR 2>/dev/null; exec sh']`. The window goes when the shell ends (Ctrl+D,
  `exit`, any status of its own) but stays for the program's own failure (`ssh`'s and `adb`'s 255, the engines'
  125-127) or a signal, to show it. Of an SSH place only host/user/port are passed: `ssh` reads `~/.ssh/config`
  as `credentials.host_config` does for paramiko; ssh asks any password in the window. Needs no panel and no
  paramiko; each entry greyed only with its command missing (`remote_shell.program(scheme)`). While a command
  window has the keys every command is refused (*A program in the console has the keys*).
- **ssh options** (`command(location, options)`): after `-t` come `[remote] ssh_options` (Communications' *Remote
  shell's ssh options*, default **`-Y`**, trusted X11 forwarding, so a program there reaches this desktop's
  clipboard) and then the connection's own (`RemoteProfile.options`, the SSH manager's *ssh opt~i~ons* line,
  `ConnectRequest.options`), all before `--` and the host; `words_of` splits as the shell does, by blanks when
  quotes do not close. **Remote shell only**: SSH link's panel is paramiko, which reads `~/.ssh/config` and no
  flags. `profiles.save`/`replace` take `options=None` to keep a row's own -- the Link box's F2 edits in
  `ConnectDialog`, which has no such line -- and *Saved links*' `_ask` carries the edited entry's over.
- **Start and desktop**: `nav sftp://host/dir` opens that side on the disk and `go_remote`s it in `on_start`; a saved
  desktop keeps the URL plus `"local"` (the anchor) and reconnects the same way.

## Departures (each recorded where it is made)

- **The protocol is always named.** DN's single *Navigator Link* becomes *SSH link (SFTP)*; the boxes say
  `{protocol}` (`sessions.protocol_name`, ``SFTP (SSH)``) and a panel's title starts with the sign
  (`sessions.protocol_sign`, ``SFTP:host:/path``, as DN's said ``LINK:``). A new protocol adds its pair to
  `sessions.PROTOCOLS` and its own menu entry.

- rclone remotes (`rclone://`): DOS had no cloud. Remotes are set up by `rclone config` itself (*Configure...*
  runs it), not by boxes of Navigator's own for some seventy backends (asked for).
- Containers and Android devices (`docker://`, `podman://`, `adb://`): DOS had neither. Their bytes go through
  `cat` pipes rather than `docker cp`'s tar (`execdrive.py` says why). The Utilities links and shells are two
  submenus, one entry a protocol, and a shell's place is chosen in its link manager, never taken from the panel
  (both asked for).
- Remote edit uploads back (DN's `TLinkDrive.UseFile` refused to edit across the cable).
- *Auto refresh* is local only: no watch on a remote directory (`Drive.watch` answers a `Watch` that never calls).
- Enter on a remote executable opens it as a file: nothing there can be run from here.
- URLs stand where DN wrote `LINK:C:\...`; the title is `SFTP:host:/path` (`SftpDrive.get_dir`).
- The prompt names the remote place while commands still run in the last local directory.
- *Communications* holds connection settings, not a modem's.

- **GVfs and KIO schemes** (mtp, dav, afp, google-drive...; webdav, fish, gdrive, kdeconnect...) are not in `SCHEMES`
  but reached through `sessions.module_name`: `navigator/lib/drives/gvfs.py` mounts with `gio`, `navigator/lib/drives/kio.py`
  through kio-fuse, and both work on the FUSE path (`navigator-gio`, `navigator-kio` skills). A scheme both reach
  (`mtp`, `afc`, `nfs`) goes to the backend in use. Test a connection's kind with `sessions.is_connection`, never `in SCHEMES`.

## Adding a protocol

1. A module with `available() -> str | None` (the extra that is missing) and `connect(site, answers) -> Drive`; add it
   to `sessions.SCHEMES` and `EXTRA_HINT`, and an extra in `pyproject.toml` (plus `suggests` in `nfpm.yaml` if it is
   compiled).
2. A `Drive` subclass: at least `scan`, `stat`, `lstat`, `children`, `names`, `open_read`; `open_write`, `mkdir`,
   `rmdir`, `unlink`, `rename`, `replace` for `write`/`rename`. Raise `OSError` with errno; `DriveGone` when the link is
   dead, after calling `on_lost`. Set `capabilities` honestly -- the menus follow them.
3. The Connect dialog's protocol (only SFTP has a field today) and `split_host`'s defaults.
4. A server fixture in `tests/` (as `tests/sftp_server.py`), `pytest.importorskip` for the extra.

## Tests

- `tests/test_drives.py`: `Location`, the in-memory drive through the copier and eraser, a `Panel` on it (call
  `panel.mounted()` for its effects, then `settle()`), and the whole file manager over it (`desk` fixture: F5, F8, F3,
  F4+F2, greying). `UseFile` round trip.
- `tests/test_archives.py`: zip and tar.gz built in the test, the drive, copying out, the panel in and out, an
  archive on the in-memory drive, Extract to / Test / Shift+F2, the archive columns. `tests/test_arctool.py`: the
  7-Zip and unrar listings parsed from captured output (everywhere), and a real 7z entered, written, made and
  tested -- skipped without 7-Zip (the official `7zz` tarball unpacked onto `PATH` is enough); a real rar made,
  written, erased in and encrypted, skipped without both `rar` and `unrar`.
  `tests/test_dcerpc.py`: `NetrShareEnum` against a pipe answering in fragments; `tests/test_smb.py` puts that pipe
  behind its stand-in `smbclient`. `tests/test_s3.py` (skipped without moto) runs moto's
  `ThreadedMotoServer` once per module and reaches it as an endpoint of its own over `s3+http` (path-style, as a
  MinIO); moto checks no keys, so a refused secret is a stand-in client (`s3.make_client`).
- `tests/test_ftp.py` (skipped without pyftpdlib) against `tests/ftp_server.py` run **as a process of its own**
  (pyftpdlib's timers are per process: two servers in one trip over each other), with an MLSD and a LIST-only
  server (`[mlsd]`/`[list]`); `drop()` kills and restarts it on its port. `tests/test_smb.py` puts a stand-in
  `smbclient` over a local directory into `smb.CLIENT` -- no SMB server is written in Python.
- `tests/test_container_drives.py` against `tests/fake_engine.py`, a stand-in `docker`/`podman`/`adb` (which by
  `FAKE_ENGINE_NAME`, set by the fixture's wrapper scripts on `PATH`) that runs what it is given on this machine,
  so the "container" is the test's `tmp_path`; `$FAKE_ENGINE_STATE`'s `containers.json`/`devices.json` say what
  exists and runs (flip `running` to lose one). Parsers on captured GNU/busybox/toybox output; the drives through
  the copier and eraser; the link managers' live part, New, Ctrl+R and the submenus in the app. A real `alpine`
  container only with `NAVIGATOR_CONTAINER_TESTS=1` and a working engine.
- `tests/test_rclone.py` against `tests/fake_rclone.py`, a stand-in `rclone` on `PATH`: its `rcd` serves the rc
  methods the drive asks and `--rc-serve`'s ranged objects on the Unix socket (or, with `"old": true`, refuses it
  in 1.60's words and serves TCP with basic authentication), over
  `$FAKE_RCLONE_STATE/remotes/NAME`; `config.json` names the remotes (`dirmove`, `about` per remote) and a
  `password` the config wants; `calls.log` and `argv.log` record what was asked. A real rclone, when installed, on
  an `alias` remote set up through `RCLONE_CONFIG_NAVTEST_*` -- the one check of the real rc's names and shapes,
  passed with Ubuntu's rclone 1.60.1 (over TCP); the Unix socket of 1.63+ only against the fake.
- `tests/test_sftp.py` (skipped without paramiko) against `tests/sftp_server.py`, paramiko's own server on
  `127.0.0.1:0` rooted in a temp directory, password `secret`. The `isolated` fixture points `HOME` at a temp
  directory, drops `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and turns the keyring off, so nothing of the user's `~/.ssh` or keyring is read or
  written. `SftpServer.drop()` cuts connections; `stop()` shuts the listener (a bare `close()` leaves `accept()`
  listening).
